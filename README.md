Custom Scripts for Yield Generator

These custom scripts can be used to send notifications when the maker is restarted or if it participates in a coinjoin.

Be aware that depending on the service you send the messages to this MAY be a privacy risk. Sending to a self-hosted Matrix Homeserver is not the same as sending to a Telegram channel, for example.
